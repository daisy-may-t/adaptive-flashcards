# Adaptive Flashcards

Flashcard-based learning API to create learning resources and track learner progress over time.

## Project Goals
- Model learner progress through flashcards and decks
- Expose a clean REST API for learning and recap modes
- Demonstrate backend architecture, data modelling, and extensibility

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Database: PostgreSQL (SQLite locally)
- Frontend: Minimal
- Tooling: Git, pytest

## Scope
This project focuses on core backend architecture and API design. Additional concerns such as authentication, advanced scheduling, and deployment are considered out of scope for the initial version.

## Future Improvements
- Spaced repetition algorithms
- AI-assisted flashcard generation from user notes or learning materials
- User authentication
- Frontend learning interface
- GCP deployment
